This is a simple password cracking program that I work on to refine my C++ programming skills.

The goal is to create a program which can:

- take a password inputed by a user
- use a brute force approach to guess the password without simply returning the input given

The program should be able to:

- accept and solve for passwords of varying unspecified lengths, within a given range
- accept and solve for passwords using any characters from a given list of characters
